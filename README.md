I developed this app using  [The movie DB api](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) - in this application it was based on a mockaup sent by Promobit.

In it you can view the most popular movies on the first page as well as scrolling between them to view more movies and see the synopsis

Who knows, later, that recommendation for friends won't happen?
  
By clicking on any movie you can view the details of that movie in addition to being able to see a preview to know if that movie you really want to watch, if you don't like it just below there are some recommendations so you can see other synopses!
